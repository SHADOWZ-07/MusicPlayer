<!-- index.html contains a form with a file input field where artists can select their music file to upload.
upload.php is the server-side script that handles the file upload. It checks if a file was uploaded, validates its type (MP3 in this case), checks if it already exists, and then moves it to a specified directory if all checks pass.
styles.css is where you can add your CSS styles to customize the appearance of the upload form.
Make sure to create a directory named uploads in the same directory as your PHP files to store the uploaded music files. Additionally, ensure that the web server has write permissions to this directory. -->
